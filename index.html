        <a href="blogpost1b.html">Blog post 1b</a>
        <p>Today I worked on some organizational stuff in my HTML files. Primarily, this centered around using the semantic elements
            <br>as well as div. I found the semantic elements to be a little unusable however, mostly because I couldn't get them to
            <br> format how I expected them to. Div was interesting though. Mostly because of the fact that it did seem a lot easier
            <br> to actually format things, although I am not certain how to exactly format things yet. I do feel like I am getting
            <br> closer, which is nice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I did some work with CSS files. I saw a lot of stuff online about how to use styling efficiently, and did
            <br> see a good deal about how to do inline styling, but I found the CSS files to be useful all the same. Again, this is
            <br> something I need more practice in using, so I'll be sure to brush up on it more, especially for the next blog post.
            <br> I think for my next post (which will hopefully be tomorrow since I'm still catching up!) will be more centered 
            <br> around actual page structuring and maybe even embedding stuff like videos.

        <h2>Second blog post</h2>
        <a href="blogpost2.html">Blog post 2</a>
        <p>Today I worked more with div elements. It's a bit of a repetition but I am learning a lot about using them, which I think
            <br> is nice. A challenge I am facing is how to properyly align objects on my webpage. I could hard-code everything by
            <br> specifying different absolute values, but that is not an appealing answer to me. I know there is a more convenient
            <br> way of organizing things, like separating them into div objects and then inserting them onto the page in a way that
            <br> makes sense, but again I am still trying to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>Otherwise, I did experiment a bit with embedding videos in my webpage. It unfortunately did not connect, but I don't imagine
            <br> that being an HTML issue. I'm sure there are a million things that could cause issues like that, they just need to be
            <br> tracked down. Over the next few days, I want to get better at positioning objects. I am rehashing it a lot but that is
            <br> because I feel like it is so important to actually a good webpage. If i can just crack positioning then I think the
            <br> rest will fall into place.
        </p>

        <h3>Third blog post</h3>
        <a href="blogpost3.html">Blog post 3</a>
        <p>This one is pretty brief. I was playing with inputs and buttons. In particular, I wanted to see how easy it would be to allow
            a text input, and then saving that input somehow. I think the post it self seems very simple, but that is because I learned
            what I needed to. This should be especially important for the React App, because I want there to be a way for users to add
            their own facts to the database. It would be very easy to have a series of text input boxes that the user would enter the 
            appropriate information into, and then parse it using the post method I wrote for Web Service.
        </p>
        <p>I also used the document.getElementById method, which is actually very useful for making on-the-fly changes to the webpage
            itself. I will likely make more use of it for the react app. I would very much like to show a different picture every time
            a new fact comes up, so I could have an image box that can have its src attribute changed when a new fact is loaded.
            That would likely require some array of image links, and just load a random one of those as the source. Should be easy enough.

        <h3>Fouth blog post</h3>
        <a href="blogpost4.html">Blog post 4</a>
        <p>This one is a bit of an extension past the last one, where I speculated that I could generate random images by using an array of
            links to various pictures, then generate a random index between 0 and the size of the array and use that link for my image source,
            but it is giving me a cross-origin related issue. I assume it is a problem with the stock sites that I am using for security reasons.
            I'm sure that I could save a lot of these pictures and then do the exact same thing but with strings pointing to their local location
            vs an actual URL, but I am concerned about that using too much space to hold a bunch of uncompressed image files.
        </p>
        <p>I have it working through the images saved onto my computer. It is definitely not perfect, but I don't think that it will be a problem
            in the React App. There likely will not be an entirely unique image for every fact, so I would not be saving hundreds of them. There could
            possibly be some strategy or syntax that I could use to allow for the images to be used, or alternatively just a website that does not have
            the same restrictions (such as LoremPicsum) but that might not be 100% needed. I will see as I build the app if it becomes necessary.

        <p>This was the only resource I used. I wasn't looking at a lot of new HTML stuff, just trying a random image generator.</p>

        <h3>Fifth blog post</h3>
        <p>I tried some javascript animating here. We have some experience with CSS animation, but not too much. On top of that, CSS animation is naturally
            limited. JS animation is a lot more flexible but I found it a little more difficult to implement. It's more about changing specific attributes 
            with actual JS. The first animation was a simple one from online just to give it a little try. It just slides down the larger div element until
            it reaches the corner, and then it will stop.
        </p>
        <p>For my own animation, I think I got a little too ambitious. I wanted to make a similar animation to the first one that would slide to the corner
            as the original, but after connecting into the corner it would bounce in a random direction and bascially do that forever when it hits a wall. 
            This is definitely more difficult, but certainly doable. It would probably need some way to keep track of the red block's position, and work
            from there. Anyway, the animation I made moves the block to the center and rapidly changes the color. I also wanted to make it rotate, but that
            did not work the way I expected. I thought that using the transform.rotate would adjust the current rotation by whatever amount was specified,
            so for example I thought saying rotate(3deg) would add 3 degrees to the current rotation, but I think it just sets it to 3 degrees.
