        <p>Today I worked on some organizational stuff in my HTML files. Primarily, this centered around using the semantic elements
            <br>as well as div. I found the semantic elements to be a little unusable however, mostly because I couldn't get them to
            <br> format how I expected them to. Div was interesting though. Mostly because of the fact that it did seem a lot easier
            <br> to actually format things, although I am not certain how to exactly format things yet. I do feel like I am getting
            <br> closer, which is nice.
        </p>

            Furthermore, I did some work with CSS files. I saw a lot of stuff online about how to use styling efficiently, and did
            <br> see a good deal about how to do inline styling, but I found the CSS files to be useful all the same. Again, this is
            <br> something I need more practice in using, so I'll be sure to brush up on it more, especially for the next blog post.
            <br> I think for my next post (which will hopefully be tomorrow since I'm still catching up!) will be more centered 
            <br> around actual page structuring and maybe even embedding stuff like videos.
